A useful scholarly guide for succeeding in *Computational Biology*

*Computational Biology* is an advance field of biology, but with patience and practice, anyone can excel. I built this guide from my (small bit of) experience in this area to let interested people dive into this vast ocean and succeed. However, this is merely a guide and to know more on any of the topics discussed here, it is (always) better to refer to resources with more information on the topic.
