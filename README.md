A useful scholarly guide for succeeding in Computational Biology

*Computational Biology* sounds very advance field of biology, but, actually is very easy (once you know it :) ). I build this guide from my (small bit of) experience in this area to lets interested people dive into this vast ocean and succeed. This is merely a guide and to know more on any of the topics discussed here, it is (always) better to refer other websites with more information on the topic.
